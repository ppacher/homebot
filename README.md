# JsMon

JsMon started as a private home automation platform but has become a framework for rapid application development
supporting dependency injection (`@jsmon/core`, based on and similar to Angular), a decorator based commandline
client framework (`@jsmon/cli`) and a package to support home automation systems (`@jsmon/platform`). For the home-automation
system, there is already a set of plugins and platform (FireTv, Weather-information via DarkSky.net, MPD, support for the TinkerForge
platfrom and more).

See the (still in progress) documentation for more information.

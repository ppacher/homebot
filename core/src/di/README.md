# Dependency Injection

The `di` package provides a hierarchical dependecy injector modelled after the the Dependency Injection system we all love to use  at Angular (2+). It tries to be compatible with angulars DI in terms of decorators and providers. Though, it's a bit different and more slim than Angular's DI as we don't need to handle components, directives and more. However, the `di` package also comes with a similar concept of `Modules` to group and manage DI providers.

Since the task of writing the DI system was also meant to increase my knowledge on JS, TypeScript, decorators and Angular internals there may (and propably will) be bugs in it.
